heap
====

The C-implementation of `heapq` in Python's standard library is very fast.
However `heapq` doesn't support decreas-key/incrase-key.
Following guidelines in [the doc](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html#priority-queue-implementation-notes), this heap implementation supports updating the priority.

NOTE: The code in the doc turns into a fifo queue when priorities are not explicitly specified. In this implementation, if no priorities are explicitly given, the items themselves are used as the priorities.

Perhaps if enough people find `heap` useful, it might be a great additions to `collections` :3

usage
-----
    
```Python
# The heap module contains just the one class `heap`
# Wanted to make it `from heap import heap` but that just dosen't
# seem like how `setup.py` likes doing things.
from heap.heap import heap

h = heap([4,2,3])

# heap.add(item,priority=None) adds a new item if item is not already in heap.
# If the item is already in heap, the method updates the priority.
# 
# heap.add(item) # is equivalent to
# heap.add(item,None) # which is also equivalent to
# heap.add(item,item)

for i in reversed(range(4,7)):
  h.add(i)

# removing an item is amortized constant time.
# (items are marked as removed and then actually removed 
# during calls to `pop` or `peek`)
h.remove(5)

# checking whether an item is in a heap is as fast as a single dictionary lookup.
print(6 in h) # True
print(5 in h) # False

print(h.pop()) # 2
```

implementation
--------------

`heap` subclasses directly and only from `object`, and implements exactly the methods

    __init__
    __len__
    __contains__
    add
    remove
    pop
    peek

`heap` also has a class variable

    _REMOVE

for internal use.
